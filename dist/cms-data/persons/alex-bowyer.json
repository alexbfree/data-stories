    "description": "I'm Alex Bowyer, I lead the #digipower project for Hestia.ai, the data expertise company Sitra has contracted to run the investigation. For the last 5 years I've been researching Human Data Relations for my PhD at Open Lab, Newcastle University, UK. I've worked with individuals in both a social care context and a commercial service context to explore how they make sense of their personal data and how they can gain access to it. As part of that research, I've developed a model that can help us to understand personal data, which I will explain in this article. Don't hesitate to contact me if you would like to know more."
